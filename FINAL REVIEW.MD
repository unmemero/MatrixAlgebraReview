### 1. Solution of systems of equations
- PROBLEMS: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
- You can use substitution, elimination, and augmented matrix row reduction.
- In any case, the system may end up having infinite many solutions. For that, in matrix row reduction, at least one row will be all zero. If a row ends up being $\begin{bmatrix}\text{ } 0 & 0 & 0 & \bigm| & \text{number other than 0 } \end{bmatrix}$, then there is no solution.
