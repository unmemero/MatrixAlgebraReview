## Topics
### 1. Solution of systems of equations
- PROBLEMS: 1 - 13
- You can use substitution, elimination, and augmented matrix row reduction.
- In any case, the system may end up having infinite many solutions. For that, in matrix row reduction, at least one row will be all zero. If a row ends up being $\begin{bmatrix}\text{ } 0 & 0 & 0 & \bigm| & \text{number other than 0 } \end{bmatrix}$, then there is no solution.
- To know if the system has infinite many solutions, the number columns (n), has to be greater than the number of rows (m). This also applies to

### 2. Row echelon form and reduced echelon form
- Problems: 14,
- Echelon form: Has pivot ones in diagonal and zeroes below it 
<br> $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$
- Reduced echelon form: Has pivot numbers in diagonal and zeroes below it and above it<br>
$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$
- Non-echelon form: Does not have pivot's diagonally. Doesn't have staircase 0's structure. It also applies if a row entirely comprised of 0's is in any of the beginning or middle positions <br>  $\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 4 \\ 4 & 7 & 8 \\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$
